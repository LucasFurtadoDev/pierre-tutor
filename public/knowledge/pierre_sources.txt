Summary (paraphrased from IET page):
- Petrus Peregrinus (Pierre de Maricourt) wrote the *Epistola de Magnete* around 1269 after observing lodestone behavior during military sieges. He assigned positions to the poles of a lodestone and recorded that unlike poles attract and like poles repel. He observed that every piece of lodestone behaves as a complete magnet and described methods for determining bearing — early compass principles. The Epistola influenced later works like William Gilbert's *De Magnete* (1600).

Summary (paraphrased from Wikipedia):
- Wikipedia provides a concise biography: Peregrinus was a 13th-century figure, likely a soldier and engineer, who experimented with lodestones and authored the *Epistola de Magnete*. Key points include the description of magnetic poles, magnetic induction (that fragments are complete magnets), and practical instructions for constructing a compass and orienting by magnetic bearings.
